True, the look on his face was worth the money the toy was not. It took a really long time to put the thing together and it has to lean up against a wall to stand. When he uses any of the supposedly \"cool\" features another piece falls off. My son has a long attention span and can play with a toy for a half an hour before moving on to something else. This toy frustrates him after just a few minutes.\n",

It is quite large and impressive and my boys' friends found it their most impressive present. One friend thought it was the neatest toy he had ever seen. My sons actaually spent more time playing with their Justice League Watch Tower but this toy was next most popular. They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money.\n",

Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!\n",

He and his friends played for hours and hours. The arms and ropes, etc. led to a lot of imaginative play. However, in my opinion the design is flawed and the quality of the toy, in general is very poor. The elevator never worked properly because, after awhile, the height of the toy causes it to sag one way or another and the elevator would get stuck. Also, the elevator was not big enough or offitted to hold the Batman figures, so when my son would put a figure in the elevator, it inevitably would fall over and jam the elevator. We've already thrown the toy out, a few months later.\n",

(I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away!

THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY.

I actually screwed it to the wall, but that lasted a whole 10 minutes as it wouldn't stay screwed into the wall. Then the scenery kept falling. Save your money and buy the cool batmobile or something.\n",

First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money.\n",

In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!\n",

His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family.

Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer.

Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric\n",

Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest.

After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering \"what the point was the novel trying to get across?\" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own.

The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest.

The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again.

            "Not as advertised: My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No.\n",

            "Good for a little while, but....: Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, \"If the product seems broken, we cannot help,\" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out.\n",

            "**Great player, but but for newbies**: I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track ) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!\n",

I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work.\n",

Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire.

I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really.\n",

This effect is particularly noticeable on \"TOLEDO\".I loved \"Painted From Memory\"- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g \"Painted from Memory\", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with.

The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden).

Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the \"Previous\" button pressed in \"hold\" mode while connecting the cable to laptop.\n",

The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device.

Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a \"Legacy\" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response.

The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while. The spin wheel is awesome ( I like it much better than the iPods because the spin wheel actually moves on the Sansa View). The whole thing is very easy to use and very user friendly.

I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music.

The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure.

We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts.

Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself.

And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude.

My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing.\n",

That is what most of the other reviews say that it haunts you for many years and you actually feel that you are there on that hot summer night, Sharon and Jay talking in the bedroom and a strange woman walks in and orders them to the living room. How terrifying could it have been for Sharon watching Jay die in front of her and Frykowski and Folger fighting for their lives knowing very well her unborn child and her couldn't defend themselves.

This has happened in other books Ive read and I am unable to find a reason why these kinds of introductions are put at the beginning of the book.On a final note, the book can get slow and your eyes may start wander when the main character goes off on his long talks about his feelings and philosophical things, but if you can get past this, points will pop up in the book that keep you interested until the end. I recommend reading the book, and I will buy more books from this author.\n",

I mean, I appreciate the efforts of the author (thus the 2 stars) to document the historical context and to give details to make it more believable, but this is way too much. I had to force myself and jumped many pages to go on in the reading. The characters were unpleasant too. I don't understand where the romantic shade of Reynaud is, when he forces Elise to take every step in their relationship. He doesn't allow her any choice in a misinterpreted attempt to free her from her restraints against the men (more than justified, I'd say). Elise, on the other hand, resents his savage behavior, but never fails to focus only on the \"gentleness and thoughtfulness\" of Reynaud. Finally, she realizes, against all the evidences, that he is not an overbearing man, but a kind, lovable person. No, I definitely didn't get it.\n",

His idea seems rather weak to me as ignores human (mainly male) nature. We have had thousands of years of war, sexism and the exclusion of various \"outsider\" groups (based on caste, race, tribe, income, etc.) Even studies of chimpanzees, humans closest relatives, have shown certain \"outsider\" males are physically abused by the \"alpha males\" of the group.

In his book he consistently bashes religion, making anyone who is religious appear to be either a fanatic or inclined towards greed and other base emotions. None of the protagonists ever mentions God or His place in the universe.I also found his arguments for Chironian society riddled with flaws. The most glaring - that Chironians place no value on stable family relationships, have no sense of commitment to a spouse, and there is never any jealousy or contention among family members or society in general. Just because the original Chironians came from computer programs and were raised by robots does not eliminate human's genetic leaning toward violence and confrontation.I read another of Mr. Hogan's books recently and found the same anti-God bias.

The casting was brilliant: Armand Asante is all that one could wish in an Odysseus -- engaging, passionate, mature, heroic in every dimension. Isabella Rosellini and Greta Saachi are perfect in their roles as Athena and Penelope, respectively. Telemachus is a classical adolescent only child, and Antichea, Odysseus's mother, dominates each of her scenes. While this production is eye-candy from beginning to end, the visual appeal cannot distract from the timeless humanity of its characters.

Schure (who was friends with the composer Richard Wagner) was one of Steiner's greatest admirers, and vice versa, and interestingly enough Schure was the one to introduce Steiner to his future wife Marie von Sivers!This play by Schure is really a monument to all ancient Drama and heralds in the new Dramatic form taken up by Rudolf Steiner.

The actor who played Quee-Queg in this newer version was more like a cartoon. The actor in the 1950's version was far more convincing.Patrick Stewart wasn't a bad choice for Ahab, but to me it was more like Stewart PLAYING AHAB v.s. BEING THE CHARACTER. I kept expecting him to shout \"ENGAGE\" rather than \"THERE SHE BLOWS\".For students of the book, the original 1950 version was closer to the text.

The grand poetry, the vivid imagery, the theological symbolism which fill \"Moby Dick\" are all missing in this shell of a film. Even Stewart's performance is a disappointment--Khan in Star Trek II does a better job of spouting Ahab's venom than Stewart's anemic portrayal.The additions to the story are meaningless (Chinese harpooners, Queequeg's \"BLAH!\" noises,Ahab's family)...and the omissions are puzzling (Elijah).And the rubber whale--who is unscarred, unmarked by corkscrew harpoons, ungrizzled, unbarnacled, with no flight of gulls--well, he looks like a rubber whale.\n",

This made-for-TV adaptation makes me wonder if the screenwriters and director even read the original book. Not only is the character of Queegueg depicted incorrectly as a Mauri of New Zealand (in reality Melville based the character on the Nuku-Hivans), but he is treated as a buffoonish and stereotypical \"savage\" which is completely at odds with the dignified character that Melville created. Additionally, the filmmakers dreamt up a bizarre scene where the Pequod is stranded in the ice of the Antarctic! They must have been reading Mary Shelly's Frankenstien at the time. Patrick Stewart's performance as Ahab however, is wonderful, but that's the only redeeming feature of this overblown mess.\n",

Has velcro ties to hold bow on bottom, sits on top of padding. Top has section to hold your arrows. Has 3 lock tite latches on outside and 3 holes for pad locks for when you travel. Is airline approved. My husband has not has a chance to take it on a plane yet so not known how it would stand up, but my 1 1/2 yr. old twins liked to knock it over and stand on it a lot when it was within their reach.

And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy.\n",

However, even compared to these releases, this CD is the bomb. The first few tracks really jump out at you as infectious dance floor groovers.

I tend to believe that if you can't write a good story under 600 pages or a very little bit more, you can't write a good story period. I stopped picking up any book over 600 pages by authors I didn't already like years ago. And even though I really like the work of Lackey, Flint, and Freer, it did take me a few weeks to go get it and then read it. I read it in about two and a half days, a better pace than many a book half it's length. The characters are all worth reading about no matter who you fell most drawn to. The world is a little harder to adjust to than the run of the mill (DRECK!!) stuff that is usually based on northern European mythology were English is the norm and German and French are thrown in for 'culture' and 'scope'.

This fact is mentioned nowhere in the book or cover and no credit to C.J. Cherryh is given for the concept.This book is a pale imitation of the original sections of the series that Lackey wrote. In my opinion some of the best writing Lackey has done are in the original series. Unfortunately, the series was never completed and the books are now out of print. I find it sad that Lackey has to resort to presenting previously written work as new. Clearly, she has run out of original ideas and her best works are behind her.\n",

            "Alternate Italian Renaissance Light History: Any book set in the Renaissance is pretty much bound to be a complex amalgam of plots and counter plots. This book lives up to its setting in history. I was cautious in approaching a book that was written by three authors, expecting writing dissonance and perhaps some plot danglies. But the authors did a very good job of developing characters and coherent plot. I didn't expect anything along the lines of a serious historial novel, and so was not disappointed. I would almost classify this as a Young Adult book because the majority of the main characters are in the process of coming of age. This is light fare that is well enough written and well plotted to engage your attention. Very light on the fantasy element, and light on characterization - - but don't think that any of the characters are cardboard cutouts. The plot is woven well enough and moves fast enough that deep characterization isn't missed. Well done entertainment.\n",

This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer.

If I had bought the book instead getting it at the library I would be demanding my money back for getting such a good example of why popular fiction is looked down upon. 1 star is being generous.

The female vocals in my opinion were better than the male vocals. A five star review is out of the question because the male vocals in fact were not very impressive at all. At times, I was so impressed with the background elements that I just wished the male vocals would just stop.

The film is edited in a way that never makes it seem boring or long-winded and the film is very (I mean very) entertaining, with some great dialog and some excellent comedy and well-timed laughs. A few times I was uncontrollably laughing it was so funny. The acting was amazing with Diane Lane giving one of her best performances in the lead role as Frances Mayes.

So many times we force things to happen in our lives and and become totally frustrated in the process. It is indeed so much easier to just \"fall asleep and let the ladybugs crawl all over you\".

Intitially, there is frustration as the maintenance and upkeep of the house becomes overwhelming, but in time, her curious neighbors become very close friends and she eventually becomes intertwined in their cheerful lives. In a country where love and passion is so rampant, why does she feel so lonely? When wil her true amore come into her life?Cute flick, but not much depth to the story with very typical characters.

When she's happy she looks like she just did. Then you have the fact that nothing that happens in the movie is realistic at all -- except, if someone like Cameron Diaz were in the title role, we'd probably not care and even enjoy it.

In the first 15 minutes, you're introduced to a lesbian couple as they greet each other with a kiss on the mouth, and then announce that they're having a baby together. In the same scene, the main character uses the f--- word and it sounds like it was inserted into the script simply for the shock value. Also, there's teenage (and adult) premarital sex. Overall the film has a very casual attitude about sex and shows some rather graphic scenes for a PG-13 film. It's just another attempt by Hollywood to get us all comfortable with homosexuality, promiscuity, and a general idea of \"If it feels good, do it.\" I would strongly advise against seeing this movie, especially with kids.\n",

Ever since I saw her in COTTON CLUB I have liked her. I guess in some minds the story could be conjured up as a chick flick. And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel.

Okay, this is a boring film, lost in an emptiness that serves as a grave for the makers' credibility.

Chris Klein's good looks don't help his vapid, uninspired performance; LL Cool J is surprisingly uneffective; Rebecca Stamjin-Stamos does better in blue make-up in the X Men flicks; Jean Reno is laughably miscast as the Russian owner.McTiernan also films one lengthy chase scene in what appears to be night vision goggles; green of all things.

Where films today would probably mock the characters in a mean way, this film has more of a sad and sweet acceptance of their eccentricities. It respects the courage of human beings who have obviously been damaged by the hardships of life but still continue to muddle through. Just like real life.\n",

My older son (7) uses that method and he can get it to recover quickly and find viruses as easy as pie. I actually took this sucker apart - the motion detection unit is actually a small metal marble that rolls over a circuit board contact - be careful taking it apart tho - its would be easy to lose the marble and then it would never work.The battery has also lasted for us 2 weeks under fairly strong use - he's up to level 16.

The only thing I don't like is that when Megaman loses a battle, it takes a long time to shake him back to full health. But I do a little cheat so I don't have to. The cheat is this. If you are battling a virus and you know you are about to lose, leave the PET alone for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, the PET should be turned off by itself. When you turn it back on megaman should be back on the standby screen and the virus should have ran away. Overall I think the PET is very cool.\n",

I recomend these stories to people who want to understand LA better because Chandler caught the essence of the city that can even be seen today.

Following the trail blazed by Dashiell Hammett, Chandler created Philip Marlowe and the set the standard against which all private detective fiction is measured. This two-volume set covers almost the full canon of Chandler's work from early pulp stories to all the Marlowe novels, the screenplay for \"Double Indemnity,\" and essays on the mystery genre plus the usual Library of America goodies such as notes on the text and a chronology of the author's life.

Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a \"British\" or an \"American\" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent.\n",

The author is clearly well read, and catching these little references produced many aha! moments, I confess that I even lugged home a compendium on world religion to dig out the paralells and little obscure references - and there is alot more to this book than meets the eye. Well, but in the end, I find myself in complete sympathy with the conclusion, and thus a truly satisfying narrative from start to finish.

And then one day he actually heard the voice of Om.

But this revelation is going to turn the entire church of Om upside-down...starting with Brutha.Overall, I found this to be an interesting book.

The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book. If you want some views (primarily mocking) on religion, then it's good!\n",

And I picked up this book hoping it would become one of my favorites.The fact is, I didn't find much in this book that was funny.This novel moves along at a snail's pace, in terms of the plot and the humor. The chief reason for my disillusionment is that Pratchett includes a LOT of church analogies into the novel. The characters are all church characters. And the god is not so godly.

Halliday claims that new perceptions of Shakespeare were developed at fifty year intervals starting with his his contemporaries, then with Dryden in the Restoration, Pope in the Augustan Age, Johnson in the Age of Reason, and Coleridge in the Romantic Age. One of the surprising revelations is that it is only with Coleridge that Shakespeare is written and thought about primarily as a poet. It is Coleridge who too lays waste the conception that Shakespeare was a wild , careless genius with little concern for the artistic construction of his work.The second part of the work contains brief selections of criticisms about the individual plays.I found this work provides a sense of the overall development of Shakespeare criticism from its inception to the mid- twentieth century.A valuable work.\n",

            "A must read for barn lovers....: I was enchanted with this fascinating book on barn conversions. Barns are great relics from our past, conveying a sense of history, but many have been ruined by weather, time, and neglect. I didn't realize how many creative architects and owners have made barns useful for both residential and commercial use through renovation and restoration. The intrinsic character of these old barns brings an integrity and charm rarely seen in new construction. In many gorgeous illustrations, Rooney describes the history of barns, their adornment (who knew that it was all because of a 9th century pope that there are so many roosters on weathervanes?), and their use as gorgeous residences and fascinating commercial and establishments - including an architectural office, inns, and even a funeral chapel. One entrepreneur even used several to develop an office complex. If you love barns and if you like to see the past preserved in the present, you will love this book.\n",

            "cuts to the heart: It seems the earned province of Canadian women writers to cut to the heart of gender, race, and class privilege. In the title piece (I would not call it a story in the traditional character/plot sense) Schoemperlen explores a series of intangibles, among them faith, prayer, and hope, and very subtly weaves them into an indictment of middle class privilege. In a later story, \"Count Your Blessings (a Fairy Tale)\" Schoemperlen, in a twist reminiscent of the best Roald Dahl stories, cuts the heart out of the woman who has everything and is still unhappy. These stories are well-written, and are accompanied by clever old woodcut clip art. But unlike many short story collections, this is not an \"easy\" book, for the reader, and I suspect, for the author as well. The book jacket describes her work as \"electric\"--the prospective reader would do well to remember that electricity can shock as well as enlighten.\n",

The high schools of America would be better off trashing their Dickens paperbacks and reading something with real value, like Lewis Carroll or the Marquis De Sade, both masterful storytellers of the absurdity of authority.

The song returns with a vengeance in the film and it is up to him to find a way to stop it from killing others. This was a nice tight thriller with fine acting by Hutton and David Kelly who may be familiar from Charlie and the Chocolate factory or Waking Ned Devine. It kept me guessing until the end (which is fairly hard to do). The background of beautiful Mediterranian locations make this a great movie to help escape from the summer heat.\n",

            "amazing: \"Motor City Moments\" is Regina Carter's 4th CD and it is amazing to listen to. It opens with an uptempo, improvisational-like, number, \"Don't Git Sassy\" then settles into a contemplative, salsa tune \"For Somoeone I Love,\" where Carter plucks her violin then make it laugh, weep and glide all in one song. I haven't heard the Milt Jackson version, but it would be interesting to hear the original to see how this interpretation is different. There also some interesting selections like \"The Love Theme from Spartacus.\" Carter's lamenteous violin is softly accompanied by Marcus Belgrave's flugelhorn. In some instances, the two instruments merge into one sound. But the ultimate gem in this CD is Carter's version of Chattanooga Choo Choo. It should be a standard violin piece much like Mozart's Sonatas. It sounds like it was written for the violin and Carter is in absolute command here, with such fire and fluidity, I'm definetly impress! One should buy this CD just for this number alone.\n",

            "Unique presentation of the vampire genre: This is a truly unique novel. Newman presents us with a London virtually taken over by the undead. Vampires have come out of hiding and are now fully \"out\". Living people (referred to as \"warm\") flock to be turned, and vampires are now found in every walk of life from government to shop keeper to prostitute. Newman is extremely detailed, and he introduces numerous characters while weaving in actual historical occurrences into the story. We get a glimpse of this London at the time of the Whitechapel murders; only this time, the Ripper preys on vamp prostitutes, and his identity harkens back to Stoker's DRACULA.All in all, this is a delightful and creative novel. It is a breath of fresh air amidst the Lestat wannabes. Keeping up with all the different characters can be a task, but if you give this novel a chance, you most definitely won't be disappointed. This is the first novel of a trilogy, and I'm rushing to read the next in the series (BLOODY RED BARON).\n",

His ultimate objective, it appears, was to marry Queen Victoria and claim the British throne for himself. To cement his rule, the vampire spreads his curse to create a whole new class of subject, the undead. Within this mess Dr. Seward finds himself cast in the role of Jack the Ripper as he seeks to destroy the undead in his quest for vengeance. With a fine eye for literary satire Newman throws in plenty of Victorian characters from other great works just for kicks.

If you enjoy classic vampire stories, mysteries, Victorian London, or just a really good story, it's worth taking a look.My only complaint is that the tangled threads of multiple viewpoint characters get confusing. There are quite a few characters to keep track of, each with their own agendas. Most of them are familiar from other works (the good Dr. Jekyll inspects a recent murder victim; when he is visited for further questioning, he's consulting with his friend Dr. Moreau), and there's a healthy appendix at the end that lists historical and fictional references by chapter, but it's still a lot to keep track of.\n",

It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read.\n",

But I liked it most because it showed the kids thinking and the dangers of not trusting your brain when you are in trouble and the way out is not by getting into more trouble.The kids, before committing to read it, also wanted to know that no dogs die, and no one dies in the story. They are sick of stories where the main character or their dog dies. So there are dead people mentioned in the book, a dead mother, but she's long gone by the time the story starts.Anyway I liked it. The depiction of being out in the storm was very true to life, as was the actions of the kids.\n",

I buy music DVD's only if I can see that they have DTS encoding on the disk (Amazon please take note). However, in a few places--just a couple--the sound quality of \"Music for Monserrat\" falls down a wee bit compared to other music DVD's I have; otherwise, I would have rated it 5 stars.That said, this is a great DVD for those like me who love these artists.\n",

After he was bulldozed into joining the family dance-music business, engineer-trained Josef (1827-1870) proved to be the most industrious of all the Strauss family during the remainder of his short life. I reckon, having collected and listened to all the volumes so far issued in this Marco Polo Josef Strauss Edition, that inspiration and innovation did not always keep up with his gruelling work schedule. Reliance on the family formula seems evident in most of the items on this CD, where you'll find a spanking little march, three waltzes, a quadrille and a variety of polkas, heard best at concert hall volume so that subtle lifts in rhythm and phrase and the skilful orchestration are heard to best advantage.\n",

And yet I'm admitedly intrigued by the warnings on the label that say \"do not use while operating heavy machinery\" and such. However, the cd provides only a single song - if you call it that - that lasts for an hour - and its really just a low thumpy staticy rain noise that remains fairly constant and does not ebb and flow.

It appears that Ms. Cummins chose to not interview anyone, just go by court documnets. Needless to say, I am left still wondering what the real truth is, since apparently this is really a work of fiction.I also felt like this was a way to clear her brother's name, as there was very little in this book about the actual victims, who in my mind, are the girls who were raped and murdered. The fact that a family member is trying to ride this tragedy to fame and fortune is beyond obscene, and I can't imagine the pain this is causing the family of the actual victims.If this story needed resurecting, I would have liked to see what the truth really is, not a family member's whitewashed version of things.\n",

The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young.\n",

I was glad to hear a book had been written from \"their\" point of view. When I say \"their\" I mean Robin and Julie. Robin and Julie are gone, and no longer have a voice for themselves, so Jeanine did the best she could to capture this horrible moment in time, and the aftermath it caused.I feel that as much hatred that she COULD have to the four men that murdered her cousins, and let her brother be blamed for the crimes, Jeanine was fair, and kind to the men.

Though this book was about her family Ms. Cummins was able to write the book without turning the guilty into monsters, she made them human which is even scarier.

In addition to some of the \"name\" bands like Slayer, Virgin Steele, and Bitch, Metal Massacre III featured bands like Snowhite (later Znowhite) and Warlord that developed a cult following, as well Medusa, Test Pattern, Sexist, Marauder, and La Mort, who appear only on this album and were never heard from again.A lot of these bands and songs are raw and unpolished, but that was part of the charm of the early 80's metal scene.

I hope someone qualified might soon comment on the merits or significance of this new translation. Meanwhile, the Editorial Review information offered for this book comes from an earlier edition of a different translation of Freud's work, FWIW. And the second paragraph in the editorial review prelim is entirely inappropriate--it's for another book altogether.I give Freud's book (not the translation) a low rating because it is misleading. It's not about the interpretation of dreams in general, but more specifically it's, covertly of course, about Freud's own dreams. More basically, it's about \"infantile memories\" he claimed dreams concealed. (For more explanation of this point, one could consult \"If Freud's Theory Be True...\" in Psychological Reports (1992, 70, 611-620), which would explain how Freud himself tells us his book is not about what it appears to be about.\n",

Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's \"Interprettation of Dreams\" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of \"Love and Madness\"\n",

Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art.\n",

The character of Dulcinea is particularly touching - where those who would use and abuse her see only a whore broken by life's cruelties and painful necessities, our mad hero sees a woman capable of love, kindness, and friendship. He sees a person, with pain and sorrow and strength and inner beauty. How can we know that this view is \"insanity\"? Perhaps it is the rest of the world that is mad, and only our dear man of La Mancha has clear senses.~ Ana Mardoll\n",

A lunatic chimpanzee receiving electroshock couldn't do justice to Crawford's facial contortions here. I guess the reason that Crawford is such a fascinating screen presence to fans and nonfans alike is that she's a relentless masochist. In movie after movie, no matter what terrible fate befalls her, no matter how many times she is betrayed, it's nothing compared to the mental punishments she visits upon herself. The movie itself is serviceable but fairly ludicrous; there are glaring plot holes almost never seen in true film noir.

She is the racist.This viewpoint is part of the problem that African-Americans cannot escape from; racism against others. Sister Souljah blames white people throughout her book without thinking that it was the early Egyptions that raided the African villages for slaves, not the early Europeans. With her point the finger mentality we, as a nation not just individual races, will not be able to overcome this debilitating disease called racism.The situations she gets into with people are not only caused by a lack of common sense but embarrassingly phony.

In one hundred years, will both islands be populated assuming that reproductive technologies are not available to either group? I suggest that Planet Alpha will be; but Planet Beta will not. Why?

            "Super Informative...nice alternative.: I was on the fence about a child birth class, so I bought this video. I watched the first lesson on her website and that was really helpful. I really liked it. Sheri is fun. She knows her stuff and you feel like you are in the class with them. It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking). When you get to the second disc, she talks about medications, positions, and really important stuff, but after a few mins it gets to be too much. Watch this in small increments! It makes processing the information so much easier. You can always go back and watch important sections again :-))) I plan on buying the breastfeeding video!!\n",

I think my husband preferred the video to an actual class. I mainly chose to use a video because of my schedule. The only thing I would have liked to see a little more was ways to help deal with the pain- like more breathing techniques. Overall I think it was good and would reccomend it.\n",

            "Save your money . . . bad quality, not DVD worthy!: This is a DVD! Why is it presented as a badly shot (often shaky camera work) montage of a lady talking to a birthing class? I really thought there would be actual scenes of a birth (i.e., a birth film as you would see in a real life class), and real graphics (instead of zooming in on the sign the instructor is holding up!), etc. Also, the sound varies from very low to extremely low through the entire thing. I had my tv almost on max volume just to hear.The information is ok, but several years old and new studies are showing controlled breathing beats all the patterned breathing that is taught here. Also, the NY accents get old fast. Again, I really expected more from a $50 DVD. Save your money and buy a book! Also, there's a typo on the back cover, which appears to have been put together on a home PC. The DVD looks like something I would burn. Not high quality stuff.\n",

I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you.\n",

Sheri thinks she is funny when she talks in a screeching voice and makes fun of new mother's foibles in her \"funny stories\". I cringed every time I heard her squeal as a pretended mother with a problem. If you can get past her, then I guess the DVD can give you the information and techniques you need for Lamaze. But unfortuanately Sheri spends more time talking or shrieking while trying to be amusing than just giving the information you would like to hear.\n",

However I do not agree with everything that is \"taught\" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!\n",

My spouse secretly thought that this Sheri Bayles was trying to ruin her child's birth. The DVD taught us nothing, 80% of this DVD is about Sheri talking about her own life..

The useful information allowed me to make an informed decision for having natural child birth vs medical intervention and delivery (epidural and possible C- section). I had natural child birth and was very pleased to find out that the pain was tolerable without medication and I wasn't hooked up to anything except a Hep lock. If you are having your first baby you should watch this video with your spouse/partner so that you can create a birth plan before delivery.

Being that we are a couple with a great sense of humor, and don't like to take anything too seriously, \"laugh and learn\" sounded like the right choice. Honestly, we both found this woman-Ms. Bayles- to be extremely annoying with her stories and condescending atttude. She constantly made fun of the people she was talking about...especially the men. We were expecting a nice take it easy approach to lamaze, but we found ourselves rolling our eyes at every digression. Although, I have to say that she is quite knowledgeable and if she would stick to the facts and not try so hard to be funny, this would be a worthwhile dvd. By the way, I never write reviews, ever.\n",

The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you!

It's just a film of the instructor talking to about five couples on a bare stage. Both my husband and I found the instructor annoying, especially her whiny impressions of women in labor.

I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be.\n",

Sheri's sense of humor was perfect for the subject matter in my opinion. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery.

Once I went into labor, I knew exactly what to do and I was able to make it without any drugs. The nurses at the hospital were all asking me if I had gone to a class and I told them about the DVD.

I love how she simulates labor by pushing a doll out of a wool hat....It was so realistic. I sat there thinking,'are you kidding me?' Sheri, the instructor, knows what she is talking about but is extremely annoying and shares a lengthy personal story for every point. For every 10 min of information, you get 20 minutes of insight into her personal life. I would pull my hair out and ask for general anestesia if she was my labor nurse.\n",

SO UNTRUE!!! I am a trained Doula and we should never blame babies or women's bodies for unexpected outcomes in labor. Birth is Normal.... Birth is Natural..... Babies and Women's bodies know what to do and CAN GIVE BIRTH. Interventions are sometimes needed, but this woman does not inspire confidence..... but fear!

I like being in control of my situations and knowing the right things to pay attention to, I was concerned about my lack of knowledge especially since we were giving birth in Hong Kong and I was worried about a possible language barrier.This DVD made me a self-proclaimed expert..

I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode.\n",

This film holds none of the magic and mystery of his other films and is competely lacking in style. Asia Argento is very pretty but totally unbelievable in the part of the policewoman. She is years to young and whoever decided on her for the part must have been blind. There are moments in this film where I'm sure I must of blushed in embarassment for Argento the acting is so incredibly BAD. Unfortunately the film is completely lacking in style as well and Argento seems to have become interested in CGI and treats us to some of the most pointless CGI visuals I have ever seen.

On the one hand it offers you all you ever liked about Argento's flicks: beautiful images, a brilliant soundtrack (this time by Ennio Morricone), ingenious camera working, bloody killings and breathtaking locations. Added to that you get fine performances by Dario's daughter Asia and Thomas Kretschmann. But moreover the movie doesn't lack a good story and shows not one narrative weakness throughout it's complete running time. The stringent plot makes it somehow different from almost every Argento flick since. The movie is highly recommended to all fans of the horror-/thriller-genre - you won't be disappointed. And all the earlier aficionados, that didn't waste to much thought about the story, will get their kicks too. After all we're talking about the maestro...\n",

            "Horrible DVD Quality, Interesting Movie: Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5.\n",

Guess I shouldn't have spent my money to learn that... The book is no different from her previous book, Lotto Wheel Five to Win. Well, the new one has some shorter wheels than the previous one (that is why I give two stars), but if you are into wheeling, you will be able to find them elsewhere.

To wit: the 2nd person singular present perfect conjugation of \"to love\" results in \"If you have been loved...\" gives me one (singular) example but not the rationale of when to use this. The density of the text preceding the example conjugations will require your own self-study to master (if you must) the ability to spin off a subjunctive 3rd person plural present tense conjugation.The best recommendation I can offer for this is as a companion for language learners who need a quick reference for English analogs of other-language conjugations, such as when you try to conjugate \"falar\" and need to know which one to use.--\n",

All it lacked was Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. This was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination unless you are satisfied with the sexy blonde in the black underwear on the bed for a photo session. She was sexy but not sympathetic. The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad. So bad in fact, I immediately again watched Reanimator and From Beyond, both with Jeffrey and Barbara, then I watched Death Bed again...I hate to admit it...I might watch it a third time.

In order to turn it on, you have to twist the base. The problem is, it goes from zero to full strength. No gradual increase.

But where the book really stands out is in the detailed, sometimes almost too detailed, picture of the world. The author clearly knows the world, the animals, the plants, the conditions exceptionally well, and only rarely does she really go overboard in the detailing of this information.Although at times the structure is kind of awkward, especially when characters are thinking, it is a fascinating, absorbing and hard-to-put-down book with likeable, understandable characters.I definately recommend this book to everyone.\n",

Ayla, the main character is left to die because her clan was killed in an earthquake. She is adopted by a passing clan and brought to live with them. The story deals with her acceptance into a very different community. She is cast as an outcast from her clan because she is different. In fact she is one step above them on the evolution scale.

Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the \"clans\" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees\n",

What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture?

An actual neanderthal skeleton was discovered that apears to have the same deformaties that Creb has.

I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised.

They take her into the clan and raise her as their own.The story itself is interesting and urges you to read on. But it's the research that's fabulous.

Each developed and matured realistically as to their own personal phyche. By the time I turned the last page page I felt as if these characters had really lived and breathed. I must also say that the ending haunted me longer than any other book I have read. The same can not be said for the next couple of books. The second started off pretty well but then degraded itself by becoming nothing more than a romance novel. The other two quickly followed suite. Other than using them as a sex manual, I can see little value in them.

Think carefully before you tell anyone about the series, especially your child, because it contains a few explicit scenes, which increase as the books go on.

I experianced Ayla's fear, delight, anger, sadness and despair at finding herself so differnt to those in her life. She is someone we can all relate to. Ayla is the only character who really developed much (and she is developed A LOT, esp. in later books)but she is the one we are all concerned with, and th others are forced to react to her changes.

I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport.

Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.\n",

It's a little boring, but may be useful once you have the background on globalization.If you have a background in business, don't waste your time with this book.

The entries (with drawings or photographs) of these one-off variants and technological near-misses make the volume worth owning.

Upon first sampling I thought it was interesting and fresh; I hadn't really heard a lot of music like this before. Upon repeated listenings, layers upon layers of new musical discoveries started trickling out of my loudspeakers. I was dumbfounded! To this day, Oui is one of the few albums I have that I can put on any time of day and enjoy thoroughly without reservation - I cannot say this of very many albums that I have. I cannot praise this album enough, if I could give it 10 stars, I would. The reason is that it sounds great; the album is quirky yet very accessible; the vocals are so different, yet once they get in your head you can't get enough of them and you wouldn't want them to be anything other than what they are; the arrnagements are fabulous and the compositions inventive and refreshing.

Song for song, this stands up against any of their previous albums, and it's their most cohesive album to date as well. The music could be described as latin jazz played by musicians with a rock background, or as rock music heavily informed by jazz influences. There are touches of synthesizers, there are breezes of strings, the guitars dance around each other, the drums create rhythms that are part latin, part kraut rock, while the bass anchors the entire album, creating a foundation (a mobile dynamic foundation) for the other players to weave their sounds around.\n",

But if you actually listen to the tracks, there's a preciousness to they very accessibly music, that although features lyrics of hushed sighs & several instrumental tracks feature throughout. You'd have to be a cynical listener not to smile when hearing the catchy guitar pop of \"Afternoon Speaker\", or indeed the acoustic lounge of \"The Leaf\".....not an album to impress your friends with.

Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister \"Black Falcon.\" (!)

If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior.

The aerial scenes are outstanding and it's actually good to know they could be done without injuries or crashes like some of the first World War I movies (Dawn Patrol comes to mind). The movie also pulls no punches about there being no glory in dogfights: if you were shot down, if the enemy's bullets didn't kill you the fall and crash most likely would.

My biggest complaint of this movie is that it's so cliche you could cut it with a knife. The role of Texan Blaine Rawlings, who flits off at a moments notice to be with his new love, is beyond belief or plausability. The rest of the acting ensemble, other than Capt. Thenault (Jean Reno), were window dressing in this piece of movie dribble. And the dreaded German Ace was hardly more than a voyeur who wanted to savor his victory by the sight of his victim's face before they died.Lame plot, poor acting, dubious historical accuracy, wrapped around some nice dogfight sequences. What a shame, as I had hoped for better than this.Don't buy this turkey. Save your money and get \"Dogfight\" -- more accurate, exciting, and historically true.\n",

Of course Hollywood takes it's liberties, but it is a compliment to the courage of these men. The action and aerial fight sequences are intense and exciting. You will enjoy this film and want to learn more about these great heroes!NOW FOR MY BLU-RAY THOUGHTS: I feel the picture is clean and beautiful with the stand out scene being the Zeppelin fight. However, I was slightly disappointed with the picture. I thought it would stand out and be more vibrant, but maybe it was intentional because it is a WWI period piece. The audio was also not the best I've heard either. All the special features from the 2 disc dvd appear to be here. FINAL VERDICT: If you don't own it already get the Blu-Ray version.

As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars.\n",

Great concept for a movie, and very well written and filmed in my humble opinion. I really appreciated the cave/water scenes, since they are often so difficult to do. The action gets intense, and some scenes are pretty gruesome (don't eat your dinner in front of this film if you have a weak stomach), but I really loved the story and acting.

Young people on vacation in Brazil are lured away from their hotel to become unwilling organ donors. Josh Dumal, Fergie's hubby and former Vegas star, is one of the actors. I think organ stealing is possible and maybe even probable when certain groups of people (can you say drug cartels?) have unlimited money. I have definitely seen some weird situations in Brazil and in other places in South America. Thank God that none of the things I have seen compare to this movie. Very scary. The acting is good, the tension and thriller elements are good and even the scenery is good. It is very gory though, so if you cannot stand the blood, get out of the jungle operating room.\n",

The dvd itself is slighty disappointing. The 5.1 sound is OK but the picture transfer is too dark so it is hard to see what's going on the screen in the night scenes. There is also a good commentary by director John Stockwell.If you like Hostel, this one is no brainer but even if you don't like Hostel, you may still like this one as this is better than HOSTEL.\n",

I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value.

The world is so obsessed with perfection that they're just not ready for this man. They won't let him grow up. One Wish is a gorgeous track. War Is Over is one of my faves. I love it when Ray and Bran sing together and the overall message is outstanding. He seemed extremely mellow on the track. Anytime is super sexy and sensual. What I Need and Exotic are also GREAT! But when you get to the last track 'Centerview\" it'll blow ya mind. It's so gritty and honest. Sheds some real light on this mans ability to move an audience.

Furthermore, the information on Spiegelman was mainly gleaned from his comics. That basically means any fan of Spiegelman won't learn anything new. There were some interesting quotes and a few tidbits taken from various interviews with Spiegelman, but it was really nothing new to me.Its redeeming qualities were a few photos I hadn't seen before, but the images were primarily panels from comics of Spiegelman's.

I am amazed that some fellow reviewers did not feel this from listening to this album. I have counted 2 so-so songs out of the whole entire album. The rest of the album is awesome, hence why I give 4 instead of five stars. Looking back on her other albums I found that there were always a few songs that were just so-so compared to the other songs on the album. She again beautifully fuses electronic and organic elements on this album. She shifts between the slower more intimate songs like \"Close to You\" and \"Night and Day\" to more festive songs like \"Cadaca\" and the great \"Os Novos Yorkinos\" (one of my favorites).

But starting with track 3, Close to You, through til the end, it's consistently strong, varied material, closer in spirit to Bebel's 2nd release, Bebel Gilberto, than Tanto Tempo: more focus on Brazilian music than electronica (though admittedly 'Cade Voce' does recall the insipidness of the opening two tracks). That said, there's none of the soaring intensity as on Bebel Gilberto: Memento, by comparison, is a rather laid-back, understated affair.

And when i make him spin to the basket then press shoot 9 times out of 10 he doesn't go for the dunk instead he throws up some off balance,fade away crazy looking shot.

This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property.

I found it shallow and filled with exclamation points that made no point. While I certainly understand and accept the intuitive mind and its differences from a more analytical perspective, this book did little in the way of informing me about the mountain or the author.

The author does very little to add new insight into the tragedy, and in fact the moments that should have been gripping -- when her group was lost on the mountain -- amount to little more than \"we yelled at each other for hours to stay awake so we could live through the storm.\" This would have made a decent magazine article, but it doesn't amount to a good book.\n",

Why they had to take such a great idea and ruin it is beyond me.

These models serve as a great eye-opening tool in the final compare-and-contrast stage of his analysis.Perhaps more fascinating, Dulles expands his search to include specific historical periods, so that the reader gets a better understanding of how theological thought evolves and changes, as one generation of Christian believers builds on the knowledge or misconceptions of the past, and how meaningful dialogue with historians, scientists and other religious groups have enhanced our traditions and affirmed our convictions.This book represents a rare opportunity for one of the laity to peer into the mind of a great theologian.

I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in.

He is a drone in the machine that is the Party, the ruling power of Oceania. Every thought, movement, and gesture is watched through telescreens by a policing force called the Thought Police. Big Brother, the figurehead of the Party, is revered and loved, and any thought otherwise is punishable by death.Whatever trace of humanity that lies in Winston causes him to seek answers, question his reality, and pursue a forbidden realtionship with a woman named Julia, all which lead to a frightful and thought provoking end.This book should be a staple in every person's library.

Theirs is a relationship that surprisingly springs amid bleakness and desolation, flowers against all odds, and ultimately wilts under betrayal.Readers will discover that Orwell's objectives are both thoroughly and terrifyingly achieved with a perfectly dystopian ending.\n",

The final part is the most disturbing and harrowing as one can almost feel Winston's physical and psychological torment in a world that forbids love and legitimates peace through fear.I am amazed that this was written so long ago since these drives in social order seem so shockingly prevalent and the spectre of war as a lever to condition responses from the masses is clearly a vehicle even in the US.

Yet another fairy tale, albeit a grown-up one, warns us to LOOK OUT for that proverbial boogy man--Big Brother, in this case, being the latest in a long line of aliases he goes under. Perhaps Orwell's \"Newspeak\" should include these additions: \"Propaganda is Truth\"; \"Truth is Absolute\"; \"Freedom springs from Fear\"; \"Extremism is Virtue.\" This book has never made anyone stop to think, but, instead, to fear and hate one more faceless abstraction.

Though the book is written in a time in which the political spectrum in the world was totally different, this book still has a high warning rate for everybody who is thinking that freedom, or better said, being free, is something that is well assured nowadays. The treath of being dominated by 'things', and not , is with the continuing rise of the technological influence in modern society still a great treath. Besides, we already have a Big Brother. The TV-program with the same name, which started in my home country, is now conquering the world. As if this program doesn't demonstrate the fact that we are about to loose our knowledge for making ethical decisions. 1984 is still a warning for everybody, and therefore highly recommendable.\n",

It makes you seem to think that you know what to expect from cover to cover. You are flat out wrong. Yes, with an overbearing government and a subversive hero this work had me riveted and unable to put it down until I had read it twice. The book can also be likened to a modern day example of Machiacelli's \"Prince\" and had definite anarcho/commune supporting undertones. One of the members of the Inner Party takes the time to explain in detail how a political group can stay in power. The surreptitious \"Book\" explains all there is to know about class struggle and how to eliminate it. Fantastic as both a political and as a literary work.\n",

Orwell's narrative retains its relevance because we still seem to go through phases where the freedoms of the enlightenment are challenged from many angles. Whether you read Big Brother as Joseph Stalin or Sam Walton and The Party as being representative of a fascist or communistic authoritarian State, the \"truth\" of this novel, that liberty, personal freedom, and the freedom to speak and be understood are ideals that should be treasured and protected in practice.

There are no glamorous heroes in 1984 just as there are any in real life. Orwell has stripped man of all glory and glamour and shown him in an honest, if unflattering, light.I was also very impressed with Orwell's thoroughness.

It approaches a subject matter, Communism, attacks it and then inadvertantly exposes a greater meaning and truth, the essence of freedom. Orwell meant 1984 to be an attack on Russia and what would happen if Stalin and Lenin won. It trascended that and became a handbook for freedom.

I then realized that we have been looking for 'Big Brother' in all the wrong places. Big Brother isn't the collector of information, he is the controller of information. Who controls information today? The media. Compare Princess Diana's life to Winston's.Very good book. Well worth reading again as an informed adult. At least that is this proles opinion.\n",

Christ, you make it sound like 1984 is the work of a nihilist. 1984 is a dark satire of totalitarian governments. No, the Soviet Union was not as bad as Oceania, but a satire is supposed to exaggerate.The novel has a perfectly legitimate political purpose, and has nothing to do with Orwell being mad at the rest of the world. You clearly didn't understand much about the book at all.As for why I liked it, most of it has been said already. It offers great insight into human nature and politics. Plus it's very well written. It is also probably the most immediately interesting and intriguing books I've read.\n",

It follows the life of Winston Smith, who edits history to serve \"the Party\" and its needs. THe Party controls every aspect in peoples' lives, watching and listening as much as possible. Nonetheless, Winston begins a love affair with a co-worker, knowing only too well the ramifications of doing so. 1984 also provides some interesting insights about how weak memory when compared to facts, or what everybosy says are facts. A true classic of 20th Century Literature.\n",

Your daily life monitored continuously, no rights to show individuality or freedom of speech, and constant fear of being whiped clean off the world if you did anything not in accordance with the Party, also known as Big Brother.I sure hope something like this doesn't happen to us any time soon, not until I build my rocket ship to go to Mars and live in a cave.I would certainly recommend this book to you, for only 300 pages it is some good reading.\n",

For those of you who haven't read the afterword by Erich Fromm, I highly recommend you do. He provides a much needed explanation for Orwell.

It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles. Most movies and books these days have more action, more conversation and less inner-monologue.

He seems to criticize a government which resembles Nazi Germany in many ways, though I don't know exactly what he was aiming his literary ire at.

If we allowed them to do this, we will fall into dispair. All in all, I didn't care for this book all too much. It was all kind of above my head.

At all times it is however engaging to the point of being one of those cant-put-down type books.Secondly this book is just as important as Hayek's Road to Serfdom. Although Hayek's treatise rightly or wrongly (and I would tend towards the latter) skewed economic thinking towards the economic rationalist line so favoured by the Friedmanites, it was 1984 that put the fear of god into people who care little for economics. It has helped shape the world that we live in today.As a side note, the final part of Simon Schama's History of Britain is a look at The Two Winstons.

I would like to respond to a certain (British) poster thus: The individual reads and relates his interpretation of a novel/philosophy to the modern situation in which he/she finds him/herself.

I just finished listening to the audio version, and I now have a better appreciation for the true intent of the work. Orwell was not trying to predict the future. He was trying to show us the pitfalls of certain ways of thinking, of the dangers of taking the human drive for power to its logical conclusion.

It is the most important fictional work envisioning a totalitarian future, and warning against it. At the same time it is not a very convincing or moving fiction. Orwell had a one- dimensional quality in his creation of character, and it is very difficult to identify closely with or feel deeply about his characters in this work.Yet now that '1984' has come and gone without the disaster Orwell predicted it still holds our attention as one possible nightmare human future. As importantly it makes its own forceful statement against the kind of controlled, closed- minded world the Soviets, the Nazis, and now the Islamic Radical Fundamentalists would have us be imprisoned in.\n",

            "Hauntingly relevant: This was an important book when it was written, and amazingly it is still very relevant today. When it was written, the world was facing the threat of global communism. Wells does an excellent job of attacking the flaws of communism while also focusing on the ways it would be expanded in the future. When you look at the technology we have now, you realize that this book was somewhat prophetic.This book was certainly not a call to action against communism however. It was more the product of frustration and hopelessness, and a warning to the reader. As such, the book is pretty depressing. The characters are trapped in their world and completely unable to change anything about it. Even when it looks like there may be hope, it is soon crushed by Big Brother. I don't want to ruin the book for anyone who is thinking of buying it, so I'll say no more. This is a great read for anyone who needs a reminder of how important and delicate our freedoms are.\n",

As I read it today, I see that it still explains much of American politics, but, it also explains much of politics of nations throughout the world and is fully consistent with much of the more cynical writings of political philosophy over the years, such as Machievelli.

            "1984 is a classic that doesn't deserve to be.: While regarded as a \"classic\" by some literary scholars, 1984 is devoid of nearly every element of classical literature. The fall of Communism has erased nearly every trace of relevance this book may once have had. Its warnings of the evils of totalitarianism were overly alarmist by even Cold War standards and are even more so today. The absence of strong, 3-D characters makes even a man vs. society theme seem sorely lacking in depth . The only redeeming quality of this book may lie in providing future readers with an McCarthyist view of the evils of communism from the standpoint of a conservative 50s faux intellectual. If you're looking for a deeper, better-written, and tremendously more entertaining book, try Orwell's Animal Farm. Even walking, talking farm animals seem realistic compared to 1984.\n",

The world being controlled by three super-powers that (if you read to Goldstein's book) would supposedly, and I agree, would gain absolutly nothing from all this. The are simply trying to use excess junk. Anyways, Orwell did an amazing job on this book, creating several radically new ideas for the time, including creating Newspeak, Big Brother (which was the basis for the show \"Big Brother\"), and, the worst, Thoughtcrime. Anyways, this is DEFINATELY not a childs book, so you should keep it out of the hands of anyone ignorant to the world. It makes you think of the present, and the future.

I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives.\n",

One of the reasons that Orwell's message is so powerful is because the characters are rich and the plot (forbidden love in a loveless world) is captivating. Not only did Orwell have some incredibly penetrating ideas, but he knew how to express them in a very well written story. 5 out of 5!\n",

A few, however, I have been unable to put down and one of those is 1984. This book compelles the reader to think, something so few people do today. It is incredibly frightening to think about living in such a tightly controlled society where one cannot even hold one's own opinions! To live without love and sex and opinions or emotion of any kind is truly terrifying. The book is so enthralling, I could not finish it the first 2 times I read it. Imagining the depths of the Ministry of Love and thinking about what would await me in my own personal Room 101 gave me nightmares. No other book has produced such an effect on me.

I hated this movie in the shallow way it demonized bdsm culture, much as Irreversible demonized gay men.I was suprised that a young carefree boy in love would suddenly turn judgemental when the object of his affections, his teacher no less, provided instructions for him to please her. I had difficulty making that leap. I was not surprised that a pianist, being a tactile creature, would chose manual engagement for arousal.I thought the scene where Huppert pulled that little box of personal delights from beneath her bed had the greatest amount of compassion and empathy in the film. It was heartbreaking to see how small her world truly was.\n",

Some of the dialog by the daughter and son-in-law comes across as dated and stilted, but the performances by Guinness and Russell eclipse everything else, bringing to life a lovely story that reminds us that youth, despite its \"modernity,\" isn't wiser or smarter than experience and minds that are willing to change and grow.I'm so glad this film has finally been put on DVD.\n",

The book starts out strong, with intensely erotic scenes focusing on Lisa and Eliot and the beginnings of an interesting love story, but as the book progresses the characters seemed to become less and less realistic: by the time I finished it, I felt extremely unsatisfied. If you're an Anne Rice fan, this is a good book to read, if just to see how she fares in a genre other than horror, but overall there's much better erotica out there, and this book definitely does not live up to its claim of being as good as the Story of O.\n",

I found it to be very harlequin-esque at some times, and pointlessly crude at others. I think the heart of good erotica is the ability to write in a way that transcends the immediacy of cheap porn. Unfortunately, Exit to Eden did not deliver.I plan on reading her Sleeping Beauty books in the hopes that they will be a better representation of Anne Rice's boundless talent.If you are looking for the sensual and dark romance of the Vampire Chronicles, or Lasher and Taltos, don't expect to find it here.\n",

Movement, jumping, fighting, flying, etc is very well done. The variety of worlds and skills required to complete the tasks is daunting, yet fun. Some of the goals can be very difficult to figure out, let alone complete, so I would see younger children having a hard time figuring out more than about half of this game. My favorite thing about the game is the variety of each world. My least favorite thing is the occasional camera problem where it won't allow to look where you want look, but that is a minor nuisance and shouldn't discourage anyone from purchasing this game. Overall, this is one my top 5 Xbox games. It's fun, it's challenging, and it takes a long time to complete.\n",

You can just do the easy ones at first, to get to the first couple boards. But then the goals just get difficult to the point where playing any longer becomes a horror. Plus, you have to start over from the very beginning every time you complete a goal. It is also tough to figure out what the goals actually ARE. They are stated in the form of 4-line \"poems\" that can be accessed at any time by pressing the BACK button.This game is not racy in-and-of itself, but is rated \"T\" because of the extreme plot line. You are a young bat (stay with me) whose parents were killed by a king, so now you vow deadly revenge on the ruler, and I'm guessing that your quest is to kill him and take over as king.It's a fun time, and a recommended title; if you are willing to devote a WHOLE lotta hours on it.\n",

I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion.

Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion.

Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it.\n",

Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!\n",

'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to \"help\" the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'\n",

From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence.\n",

There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot.

My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so.

Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader.

People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me!

Then he met this girl name Clarisse who made him start thinking even more. So he sort of came to the conclusion that he really did not enjoy doing what he did for a living.\n",

This book has made it to the top of my \"burn this book\" list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named \"GUY MONTAG\". How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all \"offensive\" material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the \"family\" argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done\n",

It was a difficult book to read, but there were some good vocabulary terms. It was also very descriptive. On a scale one to ten I would give it a six.

He begins to take books home from many of the places he has destroyed. Clarisse, Guy's next door neighbor, and seemingly the one that set his book-stealing into motion, is one of the most interesting characters. Unfortunately, she disappears without much explanation. I did see some good messages in this vision of the future, but I felt a little bit cheated too, because I wanted to get a better glimpse at this society that spawned this fire fighter-book burners.

Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime.

Well, in this alternate future, books are illegal. I bet that this seems very ironic to you, but yes, it is a book about there being no books. I didn't like this book. I felt that that his writing style was very unusual. The author, Ray Bradbury, didn't have difficult sentences, but he did seem to jump around. He would never be very clear. Within each and every page he would jump around, or lose the readers attention by rambling on in an unorthodox style.

It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy.\n",

The language is of the kind Shakespeare couldn't think of. I don't think that even George Lucas could think up such a world. Within the first three sentences I was entranced.

I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world.\n",

In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good. It got me to think about how our life would be like if I was in the book. I would reccomend it for anyone who is willing to give it a try.\n",

He writes about the future, but his thoughts are centered around the present.Guy Montag was a fireman, not fighter. His job was to seek out books, and burn them. But his whole life changed when he met Clarisse. With three words, Guys life was turned upside down \"Are You Happy?\" Is he happy or has he been forced to be \"happy?\" Through the book, Guy sees the horrors of his life, and the lives of others. Everyone is oblivious to the torture they are experiencing. Guy wants out but society won't let him go. Guy has books, a fireman has books, books. Now society has turned its back on him, his house is burnt and he is fighting for his life. There are others like him, though, others who contain a forbidden knowledge, the knowledge of a book...\n",

But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech.

            "More About the Book: BloodRune is written in a unique first-person present-tense that I've never seen in another book. This gives a very interesting perspective on the story itself when told as it's happening by the characters that are there. This book follows characters more than the plot, and that's reflected by a bit of a lack of direction to begin with but is tied together once the plot is worked up to. In much the same light, there's a fair amount of content to begin with that seems pointless at the time, mere plot filler, but much of that is explained once the plot starts to come into play. BloodRune ends with a dramatic twist, leading up to the series that was intended to follow. Unique characters, carefully placed humor, realistic plot development, and a very interesting perspective make this book worth taking a closer look. A free preview of two pages can be found at the publisher's site.\n",

            "Don't believe any hype: First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished. All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs.\n",

This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking \"What am I going to lose?\" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon.\n",

I for one think this games' graphics are great, especially through progressive scan. Awesome character designs and very unique textures. Where this game really shines are the awesome, huge worlds you traverse through. I found myself not being able to wait to see what new world i was going to unlock. Each level has 8-10 goals that you can tackle in any order, making it an extremely non-linear game. One area that this game really shines in is the PUZZLE DESIGN!

Even Darwin and Wallace read the book lots of years later, when they were students, and this book imprint (at least as I'm concern) a great prejudice Darwin had to surpass to establish his theory. It is so well written, and, again, so well founded, that dismiss it was quite a task. Recently Dawkins wrote a book \"The blind Watchmaker\" that was inspired by Paley's \"Natural Theology\", and solidly refutes his arguments (irrefutable in Paley's time, since no scientific evidence or theory had been powerfully establish as to do so).

Is it possible I just can't read as well as I've always thought I can?However, I truly think they're just afraid to express their real opinion, after so many have called this thing a work of genius.\n",

Well, the important thing about this book is that Joyce sat down and actually did it. Art moves forward by a few souls cutting down what lie in front of them, and plant something new. Then others come, and hybrid that with the past, and so on. This work is important because he could down everything in front, and replaced it with something so different, hybrids are impossible. So what if its pure gibberish? In madness there is always an essence of genius, and in this madness, the stench of genius permiates throughout. i say that we can scorn it all we want, but if we do, it should be with a grain in awe in that someone had the audacity to go out, and hurl this challenge back at us.\n",

Its almost comical to listen to my fellow Joyce fans rave about it. But whenever I corner them, and beg them to dissect the work for me, the responses are as incoherent as the book itself. Perhaps it inspires creative thinking/translation from its readers, but nothing of the sort on my part, despite my repeated efforts to sincerely read it.I've read far worse, that's for sure, but someone thinking of dabbling with Joyce for the first time should seriously consider selecting one of his more substantial earlier works, or the frustration with FW may alienate them forever from an otherwise brilliant and often very powerful author.\n",

He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the \"truth\" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists.

I of course thought that this movie must be godawful, so I rented it just to be entertained by its horribleness. But I was amazed at what a great movie this was! It was kind of cheesy in places (like those stupid flashbacks that are supposed to be heartwarming and touching but are really just annoying) but the action sequences are really good. I'm surprised that a decent movie like this goes straight to video while other movies which are far more lame and stupid make it to the big screen.

Great idea. I bought it. So, what disapointment after watching this.. it became clear that, no matter how many movies he has already made, Van Damme will never improve as an actor...

This movie deserved a theatrical release, the action is tasteful and the movie has a quick but meaningful pace. Some of the characters have some tired dialogue about being presecuted, but that aside the actors fit their roles. Overall the movie ranks among one of Van Dammes better emotional roles.

As the dog opens and closes their mouth, the strap goes tight and slack. When the strap is slack, the dog can chew on it. I would say that this is a major design flaw on a product designed to restrain your dog while on a walk.I wouldnt say that my dog is particularly bright so if he can figure this out within 5 minutes on his first walk I'm sure any dog can.

There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch. You don't destroy things in the parallel universes. It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific. If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers.

The twists in the end caught me off guard, because you won't expect what eventually happens to resolve the storyline. It felt a little bit cheap, like a 2 part TV episode more than a epic movie finale. On the other hand if, it didn't end the way it does, then it would have felt like a rehash of a previous episode. You'll know what I'm talking about if you see it.My biggest complaint is the time traveling and alternate timeline themes didn't do enough to capture your imagination the way \"Back to the Future\" films do.

Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching.

This movie shows great potential, but ultimately it acts as only a closer, giving no real satisfaction to the watcher.

This one had a couple almost goryscenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback.

I have to hold the pot directly under a light to see the markings at all. Also, I often find that my rice is not cooked through when the cooker indicates it is finished. The final straw for me is that it is pretty cumbersome to clean. If it made perfect rice, the cleanup wouldn't be an issue, but I'm not sure that the rice in this cooker has ever turned out as good as the cheap one I used to have that I picked up at Target.

Total cooking time for one cup of white rice, which is about right for two people, is about 15-20 minutes.

The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket.

It follows the book quite well for a 90 min. version. It is for the young set, grades K-1 to 5-6.It will be more palatable to many families than the G rated Broadway film, Oliver Twist, The Musical. The latter is more touching, heartbreaking, and real for some sensitive youngsters. It is over the top wonderful for all... except ages 0-7 or 8.Addl Note---My copy says 1973 on the back.\n",

From the music, which fits this film better than any soundtrack ever has before (the visual to music rhythm sync job is incredible), to the break all the rules camera work (not a single cross-cut or quick-cut was superfluous!), to the flawless performances by all concerned, this is not just the best foreign film of the year, but simply must be included in anybody's Top Ten.

Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The \"driving music beat\" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (\"Lost and Delirious\", \"The Smokers\", \"Black and White\" and \"Armageddon\"). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...\"Run Away, Run\"\n",

Maybe I could forgive Lola for being in love, but her boyfriend seemed worthless.Yes, this film showed various futures that could have arisen from a single starting point. That is a good idea for a film, but I just think, in spite of the attempts at originality, the result did not bear fruit.

I couldn't possibly think of another movie with such sheer cinematic buzz, it's cut like an MTV video: blink and you may miss a visual gag.The theme is doozy but interesting -- a slicing of the same reality in time into three perspectives. Blending an innovative mix of animation, still photography, slow motion, and normal cinematography, it illustrates how the smallest change in what a person does can alter the rest of their life, not to mention the lives of others, including complete strangers they pass on the street.Ironic, creative, and simply riveting -- a fabulous kinetic pleasure of a rental.

Excited to have a new DVD player, I bought this DVD after reading the many great reviews about the movie. Now I'm extremely puzzled. Why so much praise for this flick? It is anything but interesting: the story is childish and shallow and the much talked about cinematography and the music are nothing more than cheap attempts to decorate the silly plot. For those of you who want to buy the movie, rent it first! If you are not a fad-driven kid who actually thinks MTV is a music television and Jewel a poet, then you'll surely dislike it.

Great performance, great story, kinetic pace, excellent techno soundtrack and attentive direction make this film and it's filmmaker one of the most promising things to come out of Germany in the 90's.

Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling.\n",

Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead.\n",

When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow.

Instead, the book drags and the characters act in such an unrealistic ways. As far as the Duke goes, our hero, he has no family or friends. The heroine, and I use that term lightly, plays at being a spinster and dressing as a drab. For some reason, delights in hiding her beauty. In the ballroom scene, she behaves in such a manner that loses me entirely - as well as any interest that she should end up with the Duke in the end. He deserved better! The dukes only friend betrays him. He is a miserable man who society now scornes when he did nothing wrong in the first place! He should have packed his bags and came to america. I usually like Emma Jensen's books. There was nothing romantic about the book. Only a creepy feeling at the way society ended up treating the Duke.\n",

Then, the base fell write off! I noticed that it had very tiny, small metal pieces that had wood from the base around it. I now realize that they probably put the metal into it, painted the top black, then pushed on the base to connect the two parts.

I listened to it so much when I was in college in Chris's room that I learned each one of the ten songs by heart. Try listening to the ending fugue of \"Squire James\" at 3 a.m. sometime when you've been up all night partying - it was enough to make you rethink your misspent youth. The lyrics of this album are sometimes repetitive and simplistic. For example, count the number of times the themes of smoke, fire, burning, etc. appear throughout the album. Also, the dreadful refrain of \"I've got ants in my pants and I just might dance all night\" in the otherwise terrific \"Shake It to the Right\" come to mind. But these are small criticisms. The bass line is dynamic, the vocals powerful and the songs are extremely catchy and long wearing. Just whatever happened to these guys?\n",

In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in \"The Stranger\", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white \"conquerers\" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation.

The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched.

She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end.

In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating.

In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain.

            "CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE: Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence.\n",

For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original \"Australian\" into American English. What an insult. Really, how dumb do they think we are?2. Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.3.

After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, this film, made for a meager $400,000, held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999, when Blair Witch surpassed its mark.\n",

It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic.\n",

Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he \"got his life together.\" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others.

From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer.

Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !!

The plot drug and the resolution could have been solved a little sooner than it did. They came up with a lame chase scene with an airplane cruising on the ground after a motorcycle. Maybe that was a last ditch effort to make the movie a little bit more exciting. The only slightly interesting character was played by LL Cool J.

I don't know what gave them that idea. The brief nudity seemed to come out of nowhere and added little to the plot. I had to rewind it to try and understand why on Earth it suddenly happened.

Don't bother with the movie; not only is the casting all wrong, but the reality was 100 times worse. Caranza Tene looked nothing like Judd Hirsch and was unbelievable violent. Steven Tene grew up in a culture where kids weren't allowed to go to school and had to beg and steal for their families. Girls were married off at age 11 and had to work, while their husbands did nothing. Loyalty meant giving all your earnings to your husband or father. If you made your fellow Gypsies angry, they'd lie to the police to get you in trouble.I'd like to see this book reissued, with a chapter on where they are now. Caranza Tene is definitely dead, and Steve Tene must be in his 60's.

The energy being is given the form of a young woman. What follows are scenes of her spying on couples and her interactions with others. The alien is collecting and cataloging experiences for her race who have risen above physicality but still miss it. During her adventures she tries to help a local woman retain ownership of her diner.While the plot is weak I do recommend this film for those times when a movie like Invasion of the Star Creatures or Galaxina is the sort of thing you are looking for.\n",

The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as \"We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates\" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't.

To say something positive - most acting wasn't too bad in my opinion (I've seen much worse lately), but couldn't save the flawed project. I wouldn't object the lack of historical accuracy if the story was enjoyable - but it was not. I'm giving one star in order to offset the multitude of 4-5 stars ratings; otherwise I'd give two stars.

But the one scene worth of \"the skunk of the year award\" was the hero landing his plane in a shell pocked no mans land to rescue his comrade traped under his aircraft, how did he do that?

The airplanes are wrong, the airplane paint jobs, markings. armaments are wrong. The clothes and uniforms are wrong, even the airfield that these guys are flying out of is wrong. It appears that the film makers, instead of researching information on life as a volunteer in the french air service of that period, opted for looking at old hollywood movies on this subject.

His assignment: Coach a hapless youth hockey team made up of misfits from the wrong side of the tracks. It's been called \"The Bad News Bears on skates,\" but The Mighty Ducks is a little too saccharine for the comparison. If you can get past that (and all the shameless tie-ins to the NHL franchise Disney once owned) there's some good hockey action and positive messages about sportsmanship, teamwork, believing in yourself and coming to grips with past mistakes.

First of all, there are only 200 questions per section (5 sections) which means you will be through this cd in less than a weeks time....you'd be better off buyng the book set instead. As well, when you take the mock exams you will soon discover that they have cut corners once again and have recycled questions from the previous sections into the exam. This does not test your knowledge, it tests your ability to memorize. When you're done your exam you can look at which questions you got right and wrong, but be careful because once you quit the cd, all that info is lost and you'll never get to see your precious exam marks again!

How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring.

Set in 1984, it depicts a horrible society where Big Brother (the government) is always watching and you can be punished for \"thought crimes.\" There is no freedom at all, and it is just a really punishing and strict society. Winston Smith tries to rebel against the government, and meets two people, Julia, a young woman who hands him a note reading, \"I love you\" and O'Brien, a mysterious man at his workplace. One of these people betrays him, and, against his own instincts, he betrays the other.This is a pretty engaging and suspenseful book, though like I said, it was quite grim, and I think I preferred Animal Farm, as it was more effective in terms of the point Orwell was trying to make and was not quite so grim.

The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track.

The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them.

It's gotten old, and this game does it poorly. So get the Two Towers game from EA Games (for PS2, GC, and XBox) and get a much, much better game with an excellent amount of action.\n",

Why isn't there a beep or a noise to indicate when the rice is done cooking?4) Over-warms rice.

As a member of the Titanic Historical Society and a general Titanic enthusiast, I know much about the dreaded night of April 14th 1912 - in both fact and myth. Pellegrino draws from neither for his book, instead creating unfounded dialogues that, unfortunately, shed a bad light on some of the heros of that night. His extreme emotionalism - he takes it almost to the point of being farcical - distracts the reader from the events of both the 1912 sinking and the 1985 finding of the Titanic.

Often times they will provide you with a vocab word, but no translation beside it. You have to look it up in the back of the book or somehow manage to interpret the difference between a picture of an aunt and your sister.If your instructor has assigned this book, you're better off getting another textbook to understand what this one is saying.\n",

I have to say they are brighter then the factory bulbs. The first bulb failed in less then a year and was replaced buy the store I purchased them from, the second bulb failed 3 years later. This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs.\n",

            "Check the facts: I picked up this book because I was researching my grandfather, who was a B-17 pilot shot down over Switzerland. I looked this up in the book, and immediately found inaccurate information. The author claims that only 10 crews made it to Switzerland in March of 1944, yet when my grandfather was shot down on 18 March 15 other crews were interned by the Swiss on the same day, the highest number in the entire war. The author also claims that many of the bombers landed with little or no damage, insinuating that they were intentionally getting out of the war. This is also false- the AAF conducted an extensive investigation during the war, and found that almost every bomber that landed in Switzerland had extensive damage. I'm not sure where the information in the book came from, but it is incorrect. Any crewman interned in Swizerland could have set the record straight in that regard, and there are plenty of them around who belong to the Swiss Internees Association.\n",

There is nothing that really forces anyone in this story to stay where they are at, and as the death toll mounts and creepy goings on get more sinister, it never seems to cross any ones mind that the simplest solution would be to find a nicer neighborhood.

It still seems like an indulgent, boring mess. Yes, Brando can act.Yes, Maria Schneider has a fantastic 20-year old body. What does it all add up to? Nothing! A 2 hour waste of time. A movie with a totally emoty story and emotional core. I like a lot of stufffrom the late '60s and early '70s, but if sitting through tedium like this in the name of art was indicative of the era - thankGod we've moved on. Oh, and congratulations to the otherwise usually excellent Bertolucci and Starraro for accomplishing the impossible and making Paris look ugly.\n",

Cited as a classic in many cases, at least for being raunchier than anything else at the time of its release, this film was flat, left me dazed, it was useless. I hated it. It was strange, mumbling, sleazy. The acting-particularly from Maria Schneider-if you could call it acting, anyway-was mediocre at best. Where's the story? This just strikes me as a film made at the time to push the envelope of what was considered \"art\" and \"decent\".

Everything he said and did in this movie (especially to the unprincipled French tramp) was too savage, sick and pathetic for words and his fate at the end was much-deserved but didn't come soon enough.

Being extremely claustrophobic, that alone was scary enough for me! However, then the women start being hunted by evil Gollum-like creatures who live deep within the cave, and the film takes a turn for the worse. If you're a fan of horror films, you'll probably enjoy \"The Descent\" because it's gruesome and relatively scary, unlike most of the ridiculous films that currently pepper this film genre.

Lionsgate has packed the disc full of impressive special features which further enhance the ugly and boring nature of the film. You can watch the ugly and boring director in \"behind the scenes\" footage in a PIP documentary while watching the film.

The main mistake was the way they handled their battery problem for their lanterns which had limited use becaue of low battery life. Instead of alternating use (having one latern lit in the lead and the others following the first person they either used glow lights or had them all on.

Odd creatures come out (who apparently can't see, and have to rely on their hearing) and attack the women, in different ways. They weren't as scary as people made them out to be. Just typical-looking monsters.A big problem I had with the Descent was that the picture was incredibly dark, because the majority of the movie takes place in a cave, so darkness is mostly all around them, except for the flashlights and whatnot. A very dark film.There were a couple moments that made me jump, such as that scene in the beginning of the film when the woman jumped out of bed and walked to the window.

            "The Only Dummy Is The Writer: \"Magic\" poses the question of whether ventriloquist Corky Withers (Anthony Hopkins) and his dummy Fats are two separate entities or Fats is just an extension of Corky's twisted psyche. Alas, the answer is telegraphed too soon so whatever suspense director Richard Attenborough is trying to muster is drained away. Anthony Hopkins doesn't help matters by chewing the scenery in a performance that's neither terrifying or funny. Ann-Margret is essentially wasted by being called upon to model tight sweaters which, in retrospect, is not entirely a bad thing. Hight point of film is Burgess Meredith as Hopkins' agent. Author William Goldman should sue the screenwriter but be adapted his own book.\n",
            "\n",
            "Amazingly suspenseful psychological thriller: This story of a psychotic ventriloquist is truly frightening, especially as portrayed through the gifted Anthony Hopkins. Ann-Margret gives her best performance as his high-school sweetheart stuck in a bad marriage. Based on the novel, the plot is powerful and well-developed. One caution: This video is edited; with the abundant vulgar language of the movie removed. This hurts the impact of the film, but the story is strong enough to overcome this sad bit of editing.\n",

            "Frightening movie with superb acting by Sir Hopkins: My recollection of the film -- I've only ordered it today (August 31, 1999) -- from my youth (when I was eight years old) is that of a genuinely frightening film which has a great deal of credibility to it. The dummy is seemingly real at all times, especially when it is killing some hapless victim. Hopkins acting is phenomenal. But one things disturbs me. I understand from other people's comments that there is significant editing on the tape available here. Should this be true, I am afraid I will be disappointed. I was hoping to see the movie in the way in which it was intended to run, i.e. the way it originally aired in 1978. The vulgar language of the dummy is integral to the film, I feel. Anyway, I look forward to receiving it.\n",

            "Interesting Subject; Poor Presentation: You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century.\n",
